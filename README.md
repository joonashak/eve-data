# `@eve-data`

Static data from the game [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/), offered as a stable and easy-to-use Node.js API.

> _**Note:**_ This project is somewhat experimental and in its infancy. I am currently putting most of my efforts into developing another EVE tool. If you would like to see more data packages in this project or have other ideas, please open an issue in GitHub to start the discussion.
